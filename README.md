# Firebase: Silent Errors on Non-Existent Database Paths

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in Firebase: the lack of explicit error handling when accessing non-existent database paths.  While Firebase doesn't always throw an error for this situation, it returns null, which can lead to unexpected application behavior and difficult-to-debug issues, particularly when working with asynchronous operations.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows an example of this problematic behavior. The solution, in `firebaseBugSolution.js`, showcases how to properly handle this situation, using promises and error catching to make the code more robust and maintainable.
