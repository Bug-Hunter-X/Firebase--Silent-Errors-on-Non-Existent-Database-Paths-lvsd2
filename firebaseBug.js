The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a database path that doesn't exist or if you don't have the necessary permissions.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.  For example, attempting to read data from a non-existent node will return null, not throw an error immediately, potentially causing unexpected behavior in your app logic that may not be easily debugged.  This is especially problematic when dealing with asynchronous operations and callbacks.
